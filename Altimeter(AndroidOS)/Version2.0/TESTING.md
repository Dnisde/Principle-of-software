## How to activate testing:

Note: This project was bootstrapped with the Platform of Android mained in Java Language, which could be found in details of [Android API 13](https://developer.android.com/about). API and Reference: Android 13, the latest version of Android, includes stronger protections for user privacy, improvements for developer productivity.


In our app, the testing is extremely simple, just click the `Simulate` button then your are on the right track.

The test will be in the speed of 10 miles per hour, meanwhile the lantitude and longtitude will also update as the simulation is on.

You could also test it with `Unit Change` , `Change Font Size` and `HELP`.


### Functionalities: 

-   `Change Font Size`: Allow the user to change the size of the font being used to display the speed.

-   `Pause/Resume`: A pause button that allows the user to Pause/Resume the Display and Updates data of GPS and Speed.

-   `Unit Change`: Allow the user to change the units in which the speed is being displayed.

-   `Simulate`: The button allowed user to switchover to the alternative mode: **TEST**, where the location updates are provided not from GPS but rather from a synthetic (simulated) source traveling 10 miles per hour.

-   `HELP`: The button will help you jump to the display of helpful information on how to use the app.
